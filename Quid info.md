What is Quid?
----------------

Quid is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world based on CRYPTONOTE. Quid uses peer-to-peer 
technology to operate and to confirm any type of transaction done on the network
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Quid Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
